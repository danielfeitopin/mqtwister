## Setup

### Using `requirements.txt`

For a classic installation, the file [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) is provided.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/danielfeitopin/mqtwister.git
    cd mqtwister
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> On Windows run `.venv\Scripts\activate` instead of `source .venv/bin/activate`.

### Using `Pipenv`

For added convenience, the files [`Pipfile`](Pipfile) and [`Pipfile.lock`](Pipfile.lock) are also provided.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/danielfeitopin/mqtwister.git
    cd mqtwister
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pipenv install
    ```

## Usage

1. Configure the tool by editing the [`mqtwister/config.py`](mqtwister/config.py) file:

    ```python
    INTERFACE_NAME = '' # E.g. 'eth0' (Debian), 'Ethernet' (Windows), 'Wi-Fi' (Windows)
    TARGET_IP = ''
    ```

<!-- 1. Use `etterfilter` to compile the filter script:

    ```sh
    etterfilter filter.ecf -o filter.ef
    ``` -->

2. Run the tool using the package as a module:

    ```sh
    python -m mqtwister
    ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Be sure to execute the command inside the virtual environment (if used).
> - Ensure you have the necessary permissions to run network sniffing tools.

> [!TIP]
>
> There is a useful function in [`mqtwister/utils/network.py`](mqtwister/utils/network.py) to get a list of the available network interfaces: `get_interfaces()`.
>
> ```sh
> python -c "import mqtwister.utils.network as net; print(net.get_interfaces())"
> ```

<summary>Why this license?</summary>

___

The initial intention was to license this project under the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3) due to its enhanced legal protections, ethical considerations, and long-term sustainability. However, after reviewing the dependencies, it was determined that one of them is licensed under "GPLv2 only," which is incompatible with GPLv3. 

To ensure compliance and compatibility with all dependencies, the project is licensed under GPLv2. This decision aligns with the licensing terms of the included components while preserving the principles of open-source software. The permissive BSD-3-Clause-licensed components used in the project remain compatible with GPLv2, as their terms allow integration into projects under more restrictive copyleft licenses.
